        <div class="premise">So, I spent all day moseing around and at 5pm I looked around and had a realization that I was too scared to even think of an idea for a website because I thought I had to think of something that other people would like. So I decided to just throw something out there that I would think was funny and enjoy creating. This website is the outcome of this.</div>

            <p>First, I took 30 minutes googling the best pizza place nearby. My brain slowly swelled while I contemplated the logic behind Yelp's ranking system.</p>

            <p>I then ate cookies and milk while watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/h3h3Productions" target="_blank" alt="Link to H3H3productions' Youtube">H3H3productions.</a> After finishing the cookies, my pizza arrived and I was able to finish a couple slices while sipping on some Dr. Pepper.</p>

            <p>At last, I recalled an email from Kelly at Udacity. This email was really nice and it definitely motivated me to complete this project. Thanks Kelly!</p>
